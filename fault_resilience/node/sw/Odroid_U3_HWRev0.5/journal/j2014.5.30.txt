Beaglebone Black Instability With Ethernet Plugged In http://archlinuxarm.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=5505 


			USB
			===

- USB Hub not working with BeagleBone Black https://code.google.com/p/beagleboard/issues/detail?id=119
- USB automount problems http://e2e.ti.com/support/embedded/android/f/509/t/307379.aspx


			Other
			=====

- The microSD card cannot be used as a storage device when booting from microSD in the 3.8 kernel.
- SGX support is not currently provided in the 3.8 kernel.
- The latest production image 6_20_2013 does not work on Lapdocks. 
- Post with a few problems and fixes (LXDE under Ubuntu 13.04, Unable to log in via SSH, Rotate the screen,  Device tree compiler on Ubuntu 13.04, Unable to configure bonescript, Bluetooth) http://hipstercircuits.com/problems-with-beaglebone-black-and-their-solution/


			HDMI
			====

- issues getting the board to work with various TVs and Displays http://elinux.org/Beagleboard:BeagleBoneBlack_HDMI


			Boot
			====

- BeagleBone Black doesn't sometimes start. Only Power LED is on https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/beagleboard/aXv6An1xfqI (problem with u-boot, fix proposed)
- Problem with booting from eMMC http://archlinuxarm.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=48&t=6011 ( half solved)
- Beaglebone Black SD boot problem http://archlinuxarm.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=48&t=5809 ( missing line)


	Intel Galileo
	=============

Due to running Linux it becomes too slow, compared to Arduino Leonardo, when driving a GPIO pin (not sure if it is in general slower) http://www.drdobbs.com/embedded-systems/galileo-the-slowest-fast-computer-around/240165716

The maximum I/O speed on most pins is around 230 Hz, which may be a problem for some applications. There are a couple pins capable of faster speeds (~3MHz), and that limit doesnâ€™t have effect on the UART, SPI, or I2C clocks.

		Problem Categories
		==================


			Display
			=======

 - Problem with getting LCD to work with Galileo https://communities.intel.com/message/221141 (seems to be related to a bug in the libraries. Solution exists)


			Reboot
			======

 - Problem with rebooting, board hangs https://communities.intel.com/message/207621 (seems to be related with firmware bug. Latest firmware should solve it)


			Uart
			====

- Serial Console using Linux, w/ USB->UART FTDI cable https://communities.intel.com/message/231778
- UART problem https://communities.intel.com/thread/45725  


			I2C
			===

 - Problem with I2C device https://communities.intel.com/thread/46596 (it is fixed by compiling the kernel with specific flags)
 - DHT11 Temperature Sensor Issue https://communities.intel.com/thread/46206 (similar to the above. Some people believe it is due latency, final post proposes some fixes on the code)


			WiFi
			====

- Problem with connecting to WiFi using Galileo https://communities.intel.com/message/233443 (lack of WPA Enterprise for Arduino sketch library, for linux some configuration is needed)


			SD
			==

intel Galileo and SD problems http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=192926.0 (Known IDE problem, there is a suggested troubleshooting)


			Other
			=====

 - Problem uploading sketches https://communities.intel.com/thread/45751 ( may be related to IDE, needs reset)
 - First problem I encountered was unable to upload sketches through arduino ide even sometimes worked (I updated the firmware, loaded full linux on SD Card). The other problem I encountered is by pressing the reboot button. The Usb Led shuts off and the board stays like this until I power cycle it. https://communities.intel.com/thread/50701 (similar to above. Proposed solution is to use ssh)

- Problem with IDE https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/issues/2020 ( locale has to be set to english (US) )
