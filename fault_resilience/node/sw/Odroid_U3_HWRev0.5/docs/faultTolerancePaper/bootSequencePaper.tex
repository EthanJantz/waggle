% TEMPLATE for Usenix papers, specifically to meet requirements of
%  USENIX '05
% originally a template for producing IEEE-format articles using LaTeX.
%   written by Matthew Ward, CS Department, Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
% adapted by David Beazley for his excellent SWIG paper in Proceedings,
%   Tcl 96
% turned into a smartass generic template by De Clarke, with thanks to
%   both the above pioneers
% use at your own risk.  Complaints to /dev/null.
% make it two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point

% Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@research.att.com> 10/97 to separate
% the .sty file from the LaTeX source template, so that people can
% more easily include the .sty file into an existing document.  Also
% changed to more closely follow the style guidelines as represented
% by the Word sample file. 

% Note that since 2010, USENIX does not require endnotes. If you want
% foot of page notes, don't include the endnotes package in the 
% usepackage command, below.

% This version uses the latex2e styles, not the very ancient 2.09 stuff.

\subsection*{Abstract}
The following text provides a walkthrough of the stages from power-on to user level application execution in an embedded system. In addition, it provides details about techniques and tools that can be used to improve the fault-tolerance and security of the system, and limitations or yet to be solved issues.

\lstset{ %
%  backgroundcolor=\color{white},   % choose the background color; you must add \usepackage{color} or \usepackage{xcolor}
  basicstyle=\small\ttfamily,        % the size of the fonts that are used for the code
%  breakatwhitespace=false,         % sets if automatic breaks should only happen at whitespace
  breaklines=true,                 % sets automatic line breaking
  captionpos=t,                    % sets the caption-position to bottom
  commentstyle=\color{green},    % comment style
%  deletekeywords={...},            % if you want to delete keywords from the given language
  escapeinside={\%*}{*)},          % if you want to add LaTeX within your code
%  extendedchars=true,              % lets you use non-ASCII characters; for 8-bits encodings only, does not work with UTF-8
  frame=single,                    % adds a frame around the code
%  keepspaces=true,                 % keeps spaces in text, useful for keeping indentation of code (possibly needs columns=flexible)
%  keywordstyle=\color{blue},       % keyword style
%  language=Octave,                 % the language of the code
%  morekeywords={*,...},            % if you want to add more keywords to the set
%  numbers=left,                    % where to put the line-numbers; possible values are (none, left, right)
%  numbersep=5pt,                   % how far the line-numbers are from the code
%  numberstyle=\tiny\color{red}, % the style that is used for the line-numbers
%  rulecolor=\color{black},         % if not set, the frame-color may be changed on line-breaks within not-black text (e.g. comments (green here))
%  showspaces=false,                % show spaces everywhere adding particular underscores; it overrides 'showstringspaces'
%  showstringspaces=false,          % underline spaces within strings only
%  showtabs=false,                  % show tabs within strings adding particular underscores
%  stepnumber=1,                    % the step between two line-numbers. If it's 1, each line will be numbered
%  stringstyle=\color{mymauve},     % string literal style
%  tabsize=2,                       % sets default tabsize to 2 spaces
%  title=\lstname                   % show the filename of files included with \lstinputlisting; also try caption instead of title
