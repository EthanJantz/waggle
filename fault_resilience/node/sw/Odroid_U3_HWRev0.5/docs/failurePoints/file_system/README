Reliability of the file system and the storage devices can be supported through 'fsck' scans

== fsck on boot ==

To support fsck at boot time we should probably create an initramfs where we initially boot and perform the file system check and then switch to the main rootfs.
The procedure need to be done is such order so as to avoid the problem of doing a check on a filesystem that has been mounted as write-enabled

== fsck on-the-fly ==

I am not sure fsck on-the-fly is a good idea as the rootfs is gonna be mounter read-write and applications are gonna be running. An option would be to do fsck only to the boot partition which can be unmounted, thus in a case of a reboot the chance of a corruption would be significantly smaller. And as our boot process can be fault free, we can do the rootfs fsck during that time.

Another option would be to remount the rootfs as read-only and do the fsck.
