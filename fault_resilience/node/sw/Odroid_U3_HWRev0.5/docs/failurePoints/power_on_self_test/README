From wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power-on_self-test)
"Power-on self-test (POST) is a process performed by firmware or software routines immediately after many digital electronic devices are powered on. Perhaps the most widely known usage pertains to computing devices (personal computers, PDAs, networking devices such as routers, switches, intrusion detection systems and other monitoring devices). Other devices include kitchen appliances, avionics, medical equipment, laboratory test equipmentâ€”all embedded devices. The routines are part of a device's pre-boot sequence. Once POST completes successfully, bootstrap loader code is invoked."

This means that POST should happen from UBoot before booting the kernel

It seems UBoot supports POST functions, starting with the 2011R1 release. To make use of them we will have to use a recent enough version.

Hardkernel's UBoot source code has the /post folder that contains POST code, however, the folder seems small and I am not sure if it has things for Odroid.
The latest (u-boot-2014.07-rc2) mainline UBoot source is expanded, but again nothing specific to Odroid.
