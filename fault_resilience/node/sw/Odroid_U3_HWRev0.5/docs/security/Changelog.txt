== Current State ==

A clone from the hardkernel directory was created at /digital/g/projects/forest/getziadz/code/odroid/linux-sec

As of now:
    - Initially the .config file was set to be the one provided by hardkernel for odroid3 (odroidu_defconfig)
    - Enabled module signing
    - Enabled securefs (needed for IMA)
