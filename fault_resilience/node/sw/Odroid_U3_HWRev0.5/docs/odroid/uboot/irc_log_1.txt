nobody44        Hi guys. How fast is the Odroid U3 compared to x86 CPUs like the Celeron 847? Any ideas?
dddh            yo
dddh            where is comparison odroid-u2/u3 vs chromebook?
nobody44        Hi guys. How fast is the Odroid U3 compared to x86 CPUs like the Celeron N2820? Are there any benchmarks out there? Couldn't find any comparison between the Exynos and x86_64 CPUs :-(
prometheanfire  mdrjr: well, rc1 is out
mdrjr           so?
prometheanfire  mdrjr: nothing
mdrjr           we need the mixer patch to land
mdrjr           when it lands Samsung will submit support for all odroid boards
mdrjr           well.. all 4412 based
dsd             which patch is that? or is it one that doesnt exist yet?
mdrjr           dsd: The patch where's you can shutdown the mixer power domain
mdrjr           its not on mainline yet
dsd             k
prometheanfire  can't wait :D:D
HdkR            Can you not?
prometheanfire  nope
HdkR            I'm sorry about your patience level :P
prometheanfire  so am I

mdrjr           he's maintaining all the hacks to work
prometheanfire  cool beans
grodt           whats for lunch
ard             [17:21] <mdrjr> prometheanfire: https://github.com/tobiasjakobi/linux-odroid
ard             I need some tissues...
ard             on the 3.15 branch add dts support for the U3 :-)
ard             I thought he only had an X2...
prometheanfire  3.16 branch is nice
ard             haven't tried 3.16 anywhere...
liquidAcid      ard, u2/u3 is not tested
liquidAcid      but feel free to fry your board ;)
prometheanfire  from what I understand, given the way samsung chips are designed, it's next to impossible, right steev :P
steev           what
liquidAcid      prometheanfire, does 3.16 even boot? i've just applied and rebased some patches onto it today -- only compile tested so far
prometheanfire  hell if I know
prometheanfire  I'm at work
mdrjr           liquidAcid: can I spam you in private ? (ref. voltages you asked)
liquidAcid      spam away! ;)
mdrjr           that's the answer from our HW team
liquidAcid      thanks, looks good
mdrjr           let me know if you need anything
liquidAcid      thanks again, but not atm, going to focus on libdrm in the coming days
liquidAcid      ACTION is listening to Simply Red - [Stars] Something Got Me Started [HexChat/MPD]
deadpixel|bounce       mdrjr: where can i get the latest version of odroid-config? forum search results with no result because of the minus char i guess
liquidAcid             Maximus32, looks like you tamed your u-boot! ;)
Maximus32              Yes looks like it, I'm about to boot your kernel on U3 now :)
liquidAcid             deadpixel|bounce, this? http://forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?f=55&t=5053
deadpixel|bounce       exactly :) thanks liquidAcid
Maximus32              liquidAcid, have you seen the new 3.16-rc1 kernel is out? There's lots of exynos things added, plus the usb3503 changes ofcourse.
liquidAcid             Maximus32, https://github.com/tobiasjakobi/linux-odroid/tree/odroid-3.16.y
prometheanfire         Maximus32: which kernel you booting?
Maximus32              odroid-3.15.y from liquidAcid on the u3
Maximus32              liquidAcid, nice, is it a rebase?
liquidAcid             partly
liquidAcid             rebasing doesn't really work with that many changes
HdkR                   bah, just got to deal with all the merge conflicts :P
liquidAcid             i rather cherry-pick from the old branch
Maximus32              so it's a pull from upstream, with cherry picks from 3.15.y?
liquidAcid             again, partly
Maximus32              Still I can't load a kernel the proper way, this is what I do http://pastebin.com/4NLJNQkJ anyone any adea what I'm doing wrong?
liquidAcid             i thought you had this fixed?
Maximus32              no, I have u-boot fixed
Maximus32              I have fdt command and the config does what I expect it to
liquidAcid             "Error: unrecognized/unsupported machine ID (r1 = 0x000010c1)."
liquidAcid             that is to be expected if you use zimage
liquidAcid             i suggest you enable earlyprintk
Maximus32              only uImage supports dtb?
liquidAcid             yes
Maximus32              still nothing http://pastebin.com/4rrG4xum is the load address correct like this?
liquidAcid             no idea, works for me
liquidAcid             Maximus32, you don't even get the decompressing message
liquidAcid             so something is broken for that stage
Maximus32              I'm playing with the fatload addresses now, hope that helps
liquidAcid             Maximus32, did you use the kernel config i linked to?
Maximus32              yes
liquidAcid             compiler?
Maximus32              And is I enable the integrated DTS and use the zImage it work perfectly
Maximus32              "arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.7.3-12ubuntu1) 4.7.3"
liquidAcid             like i said, appended dt is a hack
liquidAcid             and if you fail to boot with uimage + dtb then something is wrong with your setup anyway
liquidAcid             and i would rather fix that first than paper it over with something
Maximus32              I know, I've been spending all my free time trying to do it right
liquidAcid             you could also try to just use upstream u-boot plus the recent patches (starting from here: http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/359057/)
Maximus32              *** cloning upstream u-boot ***
Megaf                  Hi all, under Debian, what's the best way to set ondemand scaling from 200 MHz to 2 GHz on all four cores?
Megaf                  or maybe if it's safe, just leave it at 2 GHz
Megaf                  I know there should be a topic about that already, but I can't find any
Maximus32              Megaf, if you want all cores fixed at 2GHz you could just use performance governor
Megaf                  Then they will be at 1,7 GHz
Maximus32              So you want to overclock ;) can't help you there
HdkR                   Put a LN2 capable heatsink on it
mdrjr                  Megaf: I'm quite sure you can explore that on /sys
Megaf                  Ok
liquidAcid             Maximus32, almost forgot, here's my uboot image: www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/~tjakobi/out.bin.xz
liquidAcid             the bit that comes as pos 63
