= Odroid Booting =

To boot odroid we need signed bootloader for stages 1 and 2. The second stage gets us to U-Boot which is not required to be signed.


Booting using a linux kernel of zImage format works fine.

Booting using a linux kernel of uImage format is not  working, which is a problem of the hardkernel's U-Boot repository/binary.



We can create our own U-Boot binary and flash it, no need for signing. However, we will need to port the Exynos 4412 code from hardkernel's repository
