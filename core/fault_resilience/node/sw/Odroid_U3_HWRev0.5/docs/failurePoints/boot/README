== Kernel Select ==

Using the uImage format we evaluate the checksum of a kernel before attempting to boot it up

PROBLEM: as of now I was not able to boot-up odroid using a uImage kernel ( I do not know why), zImage boots fine

=== Files ===
    kernel_select.txt: example uboot boot script with that selects between kernel images after evaluating their checksums


== Boot from a different partition ==

This can probably be supported by trying to boot images from different partiotions until we succeed


== Boot from USB ==

We can probably boot from usb (http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Booting_Linux_kernel_using_U-Boot#USB_Storage)

Example: 

    U-Boot> usb reset  # usb start is equivalent
    U-Boot> fatload usb 0:1 0xC0700000 uImage
    U-Boot> setenv bootcmd 'usb start; fatload usb 0:1 0xC0700000 uImage; bootm 0xc0700000'
