\section{Introduction}

small introduction on embedded systems.

previous work on fault tolerance and security

``Heat flux and wear-off (e.g. electro-migration) can cause functional units to stop working after some time either for the duration of certain environmental conditions, such as temperature being above a certain threshold, or forever'' [ Dieter K. Schroder. Negative bias temperature instability: What do we understand? Microelectronics Reliability , 47(6):841â€“852, 200]
