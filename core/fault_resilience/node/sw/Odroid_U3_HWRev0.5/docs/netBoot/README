Options for network boot:

protocols:
- tftp: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivial_File_Transfer_Protocol


software:
- uboot: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_U-Boot
- iPXE [former gPXE, former etherboot] (x86 only) : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPXE
- PXE (x86 only): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment


IMPORTANT: For a network boot security is very important. However, most of the protocols assume that the network is secure, I would assume this is not the case with us.
	   The only software that supports authentication and encryption is iPXE, but it is only x86 compatible.
	   I am not sure what is happening with Uboot




As of now it seems our only option for network booting is Uboot.
