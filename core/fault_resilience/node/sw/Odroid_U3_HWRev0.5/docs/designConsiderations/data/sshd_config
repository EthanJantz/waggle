#MaxStartups
## Specifies the maximum number of concurrent unauthenticated connections to the SSH daemon.
## Additional connections will be dropped until authentication succeeds or the LoginGraceTime
## expires for a connection.  The default is 10.
## Alternatively, random early drop can be enabled by specifying the three colon separated
## values "start:rate:full" (e.g. "10:30:60").  sshd(8) will refuse connection attempts with
## a probability of "rate/100" (30%) if there are currently "start" (10) unauthenticated
## connections.  The probability increases linearly and all connection attempts are refused if
## the number of unauthenticated connections reaches "full" (60).
MaxStartups 2:30:10

#Banner
## The contents of the specified file are sent to the remote user before authentication is
## allowed. If the argument is "none" then no banner is displayed.  This option is only available for protocol version 2.  By
             default, no banner is displayed.

# Set this to 'yes' to enable PAM authentication, account processing,
# and session processing. If this is enabled, PAM authentication will
# be allowed through the ChallengeResponseAuthentication and
# PasswordAuthentication.  Depending on your PAM configuration,
# PAM authentication via ChallengeResponseAuthentication may bypass
# the setting of "PermitRootLogin without-password".
# If you just want the PAM account and session checks to run without
# PAM authentication, then enable this but set PasswordAuthentication
# and ChallengeResponseAuthentication to 'no'.
