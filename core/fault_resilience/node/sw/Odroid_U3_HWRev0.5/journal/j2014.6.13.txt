  ==================

Created an basic image to use for odroid U3 linaro-nano-8G.2014.06.13.16.59.img

image copies reside at:

bishop.mcs.anl.gov @ /digital/http/linux_devel/odroid/images
bishop.mcs.anl.gov @ /digital/g/projects/forest/getziadz/code/sdcardTools/backupImage

There are still problems with automatic creation of the rootfs

when trying to cross create the rootfs, meaning to create an arm rootfs in a x86 host, the problem resides when trying to chroot and do the configuration. The script does not seem to "understand" it needs to do that inside an emulated ARM chroot.

when trying to create the rootfs nativelly in an ARM board there was still failure however we did not investigate further and just created an image manually so as to go forward with the project.
