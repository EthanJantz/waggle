"""
    stresslinux is a minimal linux distribution running from a bootable cdrom, usb, vmware or via PXE (wip).
    stresslinux makes use of some utitlities available on the net like: stress, cpuburn, hddtemp, lm_sensors ...
    stresslinux is dedicated to users who want to test their system(s) entirely on high load and monitoring the health.

=== stress [Works fine] [Compiles/Runs on ARM]

Official site: http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~apw/stress/

it is a bit outdated so instead we should use stress-ng: http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~cking/stress-ng/

"""
Stress-ng can stress various subsystems of a computer. One can load CPU, memory, I/O sync, disk writes, forks and context switches. It is a cleanroom re-write of the original stress tool by Amos Waterland but has addition features such as specifying the number of bogo operations to run, execution metrics and additional stress tasks.
"""


=== stressapptest [Works fine] [Does not compile on ARM, we need to enable support for armv7l (it already supports armv7a]

Official site: https://code.google.com/p/stressapptest/

"""
Stressful Application Test (or stressapptest, its unix name) tries to maximize randomized traffic to memory from processor and I/O, with the intent of creating a realistic high load situation in order to test the existing hardware devices in a computer. It has been used at Google for some time and now it is available under the apache 2.0 license.
"""

=== CPU burn

not found

=== nbench [Works fine, but does not look very configurable] [Compiles/Runs on ARM]

Official site: http://www.tux.org/~mayer/linux/bmark.html

"""
These are Native Mode (a.k.a. Algorithm Level) tests; benchmarks designed to expose the capabilities of a system's CPU, FPU, and memory system
"""

=== tiobench [Compiles on ARM]


http://sourceforge.net/projects/tiobench/

"""
Portable, fully-threaded I/O benchmark program
"""

=== mprime

http://www.mersenne.org/download/

Probably not useful to us due to, follows excerpt from the website, "The source code for the program is highly optimized Intel assembly language"

=== hddtemp

http://www.guzu.net/linux/hddtemp.php

 "hddtemp is a small utility (daemonizable) that gives you the temperature of your hard drive by reading S.M.A.R.T. informations (for drives that support this feature)."

I believe it does not apply to us as we use SDCards

=== lm_sensors

It may need tweaking to work at odroid

=== lshw

same as previous

=== bonnie++

http://www.coker.com.au/bonnie++/

"Bonnie++ is a benchmark suite that is aimed at performing a number of simple tests of hard drive and file system performance. Then you can decide which test is important and decide how to compare different systems after running it. I have no plans to ever have it produce a single number, because I don't think that a single number can be useful when comparing such things."

Not a priority for us.

=== netio

http://freecode.com/projects/netio
http://www.ars.de/ars/ars.nsf/docs/netio

"This is a network benchmark for OS/2 2.x, Windows, Linux and Unix. It measures the net throughput of a network via TCP and UDP protocols using various different packet sizes. One instance has to run on one machine as a server process, another instance is used on another machine to perform the benchmark. When executed without arguments, the program will explain its usage."

=== nepim

http://www.nongnu.org/nepim/

"nepim stands for network pipemeter, a tool for measuring available bandwidth between hosts. nepim is also useful to generate network traffic for testing purposes. nepim operates in client/server mode, is able to handle multiple parallel traffic streams, reports periodic partial statistics along the testing, accepts rich tuning from command-line, supports multicast and IPv6."

=== netperf

http://www.netperf.org/netperf/NetperfPage.html

 Netperf is a benchmark that can be used to measure the performance of many different types of networking. It provides tests for both unidirectional throughput, and end-to-end latency. The environments currently measureable by netperf include:

    TCP and UDP via BSD Sockets for both IPv4 and IPv6
    DLPI
    Unix Domain Sockets
    SCTP for both IPv4 and IPv6 

=== iperf

Probably not needed

=== smartmontools

For hard drives

=== x86info

Not needed

=== memtester [Compiles on ARM]
http://pyropus.ca/software/memtester

"A userspace utility for testing the memory subsystem for faults. It's portable and should compile and work on any 32- or 64-bit Unix-like system. (Yes, even weird, proprietary Unices, and even Mac OS X.) For hardware developers, memtester can be told to test memory starting at a particular physical address as of memtester version 4.1.0."

=== bandwidth

http://zsmith.co/bandwidth.html

"My program, called simply bandwidth, is an artificial benchmark primarily for measuring memory bandwidth on x86 and x86_64 based computers, useful for identifying weaknesses in a computer's memory subsystem, in the bus architecture, in the cache architecture and in the processor itself."

Highly unlikely to use, contains x86 assembly files


=== memtest86

Proprietary

=== memtest86+

http://www.memtest.org/

Seem to be x86 specific

=== ramspeed

http://alasir.com/software/ramspeed/

"a cache and memory benchmarking tool"

No ARM but may be easy to extend

=== y-cruncher
http://www.numberworld.org/y-cruncher/

Does not look so interesting

=== tw_cli
=== arecacli
