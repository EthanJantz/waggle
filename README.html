<h1>This is the waggle project</h1>

<p>homepage: www.wa8.gl</p>

<h2>A very high level view of the pieces of this project are:</h2>

<p>1) A Node Controller.  This is the Linux-based brain for a sensor
node.  Currently, we are using a hardkernel.com ODROID single-board
computer to be the Node Controller.  In addition to a mostly stock
Linux, the Node Controller has waggle's communication libraries, extra
resilience features, and support for in-situ processing</p>

<p>2) The WagMan system management board for managing a sensor node.
This is the failsafe for the node.  It can power-cycle components,
detect when the waggle node is too hot, etc.</p>

<p>3) The Waggle Sensor Boards (AirSense, ChemSense, and LightSense)</p>

<p>4) The Cloud-based software (Beehive)</p>

<h2>Directories</h2>

<p>The directories are organized as follows (in alphabetical order)</p>

<p>beehive: the software run on the cloud server
    docs: documentation of the cloud server
    msging: the cloud-side of the message layer
    wag-view: A nice front end for browsing the data
    wag-db: the backend storage scripts </p>

<p>build: all of the pieces are built (compiled, configured) and
                  installed into this directory</p>

<p>comlink: the communication link (wifi router, etc)</p>

<p>devtools: tools needed to build and install waggle</p>

<p>docs: waggle-wide documentation.  This directory is the result of
              building all the docs found in the subdirectories</p>

<p>guestnode: All the software that lives on the guestnodes (ODROID)
    docs: documentation of guestnodes
    nc-baseos: The core Linux OS distro from which we start
    nc-wag-os: The guestnode software stack, including the basic OS
        waggled: The command controller and client console
        resilience: tools and scripts, such as heartbeat for deep-space operation
        personalization: scripts and config files for personalizing a node
    externs: external packages added to make the basic Waggle OS better
    in-situ: audio and image computing done inside the guestnode</p>

<p>nodecontroller: All the software that lives on the Node Controller (ODROID)
    docs: documentation of node controller
    nc-baseos: The core Linux OS distro from which we start
    nc-wag-os: The Node Controller software stack, including the basic OS
        waggled: The command controller and client console
        msging: The remote messaging service to the cloud
        resilience: tools and scripts, such as heartbeat for deep-space operation
        personalization: scripts and config files for personalizing a node
    externs: external packages added to make the basic Waggle OS better</p>

<p>sensors: all of the code to interact with and read data from sensors
    envsense: the core environmental sensing board
        docs: documentation of the envsense software / hardware environment, and sensors
        reader: code (firmware) running on the envsense board
    anemometer: an experiemental anemometer
        docs: documentation of the system
    reader: code to read and generate a value</p>

<p>testing: the waggle testing framework</p>

<p>wagman: waggle system management board software
    docs: documentation of the waggle management software / hardware environment
    manager: code (firmware) loaded onto system management board</p>

<p>(other): a temporary holding place for things that have not yet found
a home in the structure above.</p>
