## Instructions

1. Insert stress-test SD-card into unpowered ODROID.
2. The XU4 boot switch must have SD-card selected. If the swicth has been replaced by three wires, short the uSD and center wire to make sure the SD-card will be booted. (Keep the wires shorted the whole time, in case of a reboot)
3. Plug power connector into ODROID.
4. After 4-5 minutes connect the label printer using the USB connector:
  - Success: Label printer prints barcode label (without "ERROR")
  - Error 1: Label printer prints barcode label with "ERROR"
  - Error 2: Label printer does not print a label.
5. On success stick the new label on top of the Ethernet port of the Odroid. The barcode should go on top and the text should go to the side. The barcode should be placed entirely on the top and not folded across the edge.
