 # To install disable the old way of doing things:
 #
 #   /etc/init.d/monit stop && update-rc.d -f monit remove
 #
 # then put this script here:
 #
 #   /etc/init/monit.conf
 #
 # and reload upstart configuration:
 #
 #   initctl reload-configuration
 #
 # You can manually start and stop monit like this:
 # 
 # start monit
 # stop monit
