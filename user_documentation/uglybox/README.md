## Uglybox and Uglykit 

The Uglybox and Uglykit are easily accessible and tinkerer friendly implementaions of the Waggle Platform. The Uglybox is a field deployable form of the Uglykit. Keeping with the extensible and modular architecture of the Waggle Platform, the Uglyboxes or kits can come in various sensor configurations, but are often built with the **Metsense, Lightsense, Chemsense boards, two cameras - one pointing up and other sideways.** Other sensors often added to these devices include _Particle Sensors (PM2.5 and PM10), Rain Gauges, Soil Moisture sensors and Microphones_.
