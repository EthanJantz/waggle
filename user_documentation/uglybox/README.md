## Uglybox and Uglykit 

The Uglybox and Uglykit are easily accessible and tinkerer friendly implementaions of the [Waggle Platform](http://wa8.gl/?page_id=154). The Uglybox is a field deployable form of the Uglykit. These devices come with 

Keeping with the extensible and modular architecture of the Waggle Platform, the Uglyboxes or kits can come in various sensor configurations, but are often built with the **[Metsense](https://github.com/waggle-sensor/sensors/tree/master#metsense-hw-ver-31), [Lightsense](https://github.com/waggle-sensor/sensors/tree/master#lightsense-hw-ver-31), [Chemsense boards](https://github.com/waggle-sensor/sensors/tree/master#chemsense-hw-ver-passamaquoddy-bay), two cameras - [one pointing up](http://www.elpcctv.com/8mp-highdefinition-usb-camera-module-usb20-sony-imx179-color-cmos-sensor-75degree-lens-p-223.html) [and other sideways](http://www.elpcctv.com/5megapixel-usb-camera-module-usb20-omnivision-ov5640-color-cmos-sensor-21mm-lens-p-215.html).** Other sensors often added to these devices include _Particle Sensors (PM2.5 and PM10), Rain Gauges, Soil Moisture sensors and Microphones_.

## Data Flow

Like all Waggle systems, the ugly devices make a connection to the Beehive Server (beehive1.mcs.anl.gov) located at Argonne. The connections enable the devices to send sensor data to the [central data repository](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/waggle/downloads/beehive1/), receive timely software and firmware updates, and also allow remote debugging of the devices. Every node has a Name and ID assigned to it, 
and the standard set of sensor data generated by the nodes are available for download from the [central data repository](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/waggle/downloads/beehive1/). The [Node Controller](http://www.hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php?g_code=G143703355573) makes the required connections to the Beehive Server. [The Edge Processor]()


## Network Connectivity

Waggle nodes (Uglyboxes and kits) do not expose any local network connectivity options. However, they make outbound connections to 
three different ports on `beehive1.mcs.anl.gov (140.221.47.66)`- 
  - Data communication:  Port 23181, SSL encrypted RabbitMQ
  - Management Console: Port 20022, SSH connection
  - Web: Port 80, HTTP
